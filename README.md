test

I am developing a new API - fetchAllPromoRequests. I am co-ordinating with Rohith for it.

I need to create new Table, new Entity and map them to DTO. Besides that I have finished other parts of the API.
I will continue on it tomorrow morning
Hi, I created the client request and tested the Api. After that I debugged the code, changed the development env. and tried minor changes. I dint face any issues. I got the correct response.

Hi, I have finished the code changes, fixed the compilation errors and resolved build issues.Now I am creating Db Script for the API and testing it locally
My laptop was lagging a little and citrix was slow as well. So I closed all the unnecessary applications. I hope it frees the memory.





5:34
Now I will create Db Script for the API and test it locally
