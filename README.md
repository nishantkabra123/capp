test

I am developing a new API - fetchAllPromoRequests. I am co-ordinating with Rohith for it.

I need to create new Table, new Entity and map them to DTO. Besides that I have finished other parts of the API.
I will continue on it tomorrow morning
Hi, I created the client request and tested the Api. After that I debugged the code, changed the development env. and tried minor changes. I dint face any issues. I got the correct response.
